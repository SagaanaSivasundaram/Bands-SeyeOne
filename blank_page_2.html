        <p class="General-info">NewJeans is composed of 5 members born between 2004 and 2008. Their ages ranged from 14 to 18 years old at the time of their debut in 2022. The oldest member is Minji. She was born on May 7, 2004, and was 18 years old at the time of their debut. The youngest member is Hyein.

Hyein, Minji, and Haerin are Korean. 
        Hanni is Vietnamese-Australian. Danielle is Korean-Australian.All of the members are able to speak basic English. Danielle and Hanni's English is fluent while Minji's is advanced.
        Members were selected during the 2019 global auditions by Big Hit and Source Entertainment and have been training for over 2 years.
        NewJeans has influenced fashion and make-up trends with their style, developed by Choi Yu-mi. Having previously met Min while working with Shinee, Choi began working with Min and NewJeans in 2020, despite never having styled a girl group. NewJeans debuted with a Y2K-inspired style that established them as "a symbol" of the Y2K fashion revival in South Korea. The members wore "drastically" different outfits in the music videos to confuse fans, prompting them to rewatch the videos to identify the members. For their hair and make-up, NewJeans worked with hairstylist Gi-hee and make-up artist Lee Nak-yeum, who developed a signature "natural" look for the group. Azrin Tan argued in Vogue Singapore that NewJeans presented a "new aesthetic", characterized by minimal soft make-up and straight black hair, that defied beauty standards in the contemporary K-pop industry with its simplicity.[84] Their styling contributed in shaping NewJeans' girl-next-door image, deemed by Tan a "stark shift away from the usually high-octane aesthetic" of contemporary K-pop groups.</p>
