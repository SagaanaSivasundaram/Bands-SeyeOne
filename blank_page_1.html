The current members include Xiumin, Suho, Baekhyun, Chen, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun. Upon debut, the group was divided into the Korean subunit EXO-K and the Chinese subunit EXO-M, with "K" representing Korean and "M" representing Mandarin. The name EXO is derived from the term "exoplanet," symbolizing the group as "new stars from an unknown planet." They initially operated in both South Korea and China, gradually expanding their global presence. In addition to the main group, there are subunits like EXO-CBX (three members) and EXO-SC (two members). Since their debut, EXO has gained significant popularity in Asia and received numerous music awards and fan accolades in China, Japan, and South Korea.                 Exo have won numerous awards, including five consecutive Album of the Year awards at the Mnet Asian Music Awards and two consecutive Artist of the Year awards at the Melon Music Awards, and have performed over 100 concerts across four headlining tours and multiple joint tours. The group ranked as one of the top five most influential celebrities on the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 list from 2014 to 2018 and have been labeled "Kings of K-pop" and the "biggest boyband in the world" by various media outlets. Outside of music, the group members have endorsed brands such as Nature Republic and Samsung and participate in philanthropic efforts such as Smile For U, an ongoing project by SM Entertainment and UNICEF that began in 2015.</p>            </p>        </div>        <a href="read-more.html" class="read-more-btn-first">Read More</a>                <a href="#">            <img src="c64ae6e8987706faf382db546af36e39.webp" alt="Exo introduction photo" class="intro-image">        </a>    </div><div class="second-phase">    <div class="image-container">        <img src="Pi7_Tool_tempImageJdNdRL.heic" class="img1" alt="Image 1">        <img src="Pi7_Tool_tempImagedQTzh7.heic" class="img2" alt="Image 2">    </div>    <div class="text-container">        <h1>General info</h1>        <p class="General-info">EXO initially debuted with twelve members which were separated into two sub-groups: EXO-K, a unit that focused on South Korean content which consisted of Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, Kai, and D.O. And the Chinese-focused unit EXO-M which included Xiumin, Lay, Chen, and former members Kris, Luhan, and Tao. However, following the former members' departure in 2014, EXO began to actively promote as a whole nine-member group.        EXO continued to release chart-topping music over the years and solidified their status as one of the legendary boy groups of South Korea. They also went on to have their first sub-unit in 2016, EXO-CBX, which comprised of Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin. Three years later, in 2019, they had their second sub-unit, EXO-SC, which was a duo consisting of Sehun and Chanyeol. Along with the members' solo releases, the sub-units became massive hits worldwide.        On June 1, 2023, Baekhyun, Chen, and Xiumin revealed the termination of their exclusive contracts with SM Entertainment.        On October 18, it was confirmed that D.O. would be leaving SM Entertainment as his contract with them is set to expire in early November, however, he will keep being part of EXO.        On January 7, 2024, SM Entertainment announced that members Xiumin, Baekhyun, and Chen will carry out their solo activities and EXO-CBX activities under Baekhyun's newly established label "I&B 100".
